            <h2>Early Life and Capture</h2>
            <p>Herman Lehmann was born in Gillespie County, Texas on June 5, 1859, to German immigrants living in the Prince Solms Colony. His home was built, knowingly or unknowingly, in an area controlled by the Apaches who frequently raided the area in search of horses, loot, and scalps. At the age of 11 while playing in the fields with his siblings a raiding party of ten Apaches captured Herman and his brother. They beat him, tied him up, and secured him to the back of a horse and quickly made their escape. During the following week Herman was tortured, deprived of food and water, and separated from his brother. After some time they reached the Apache village where he remained for the next six years.</p>

            <h2>Captivity Among the Apaches</h2>
            <p>A few months after his capture, the Apaches told Herman that they had killed his entire family, which removed any incentive of trying to escape. He was eventually adopted by one of his captors named Carnoviste and his wife, Laughing Eyes. He spent about six years with the Apaches eventually rising to the rank of petty chief in the tribe. He fought many battles alongside the Apaches against enemy tribes as well as the Texas Rangers. He spent his days as an Apache brave raiding settlements, stealing horses, and raising hell on the prairie. Around 1876, six years after his capture, there was internal strife among the Apaches resulting in his master Carnoviste being killed by a rival medicine man. Herman killed medicine man in retaliation, and fled the tribe spending a year alone in hiding on the vast prairie.</p>

            <h2>Refuge Among the Comanches</h2>
            <p>After a year of evading the Apaches on the plains, Herman grew lonely and tired of running. One night he heard voices in the distance, and upon closer inspection found a small band of Comanches sitting around a fire. The Comanches at this time were at war with the Apaches and white settlers, but driven by loneliness, Herman walked into the middle of their camp and put his hands up. After their initial shock brif attempt to kill him, he explained to them all that had happened. A Comanche brave came forward and verified his story as he had heard that the medicine man had been killed. After deliberation he was welcomed to stay and eventually became a full member of the Comanche tribe. After two years of living among the Comanches, Chief Quanah Parker successfully negotiated the surrender of the last fighting Comanche band, and in turn adopted Herman as his son who lived with him on the reservation in Oklahoma.</p>

            <h2>Herman's Return to his Family</h2>
            <p>After a year of living with Quanah on the reservation, the Army took notice of Herman living among the Comanches. Against his will, Herman was escorted back to his home in Gillespie County nine years after his initial capture. Upon his arrival neither he nor his mother recognized one another, but his sister recognized a scar on his arm from when they were children verifying his identity. Slowly his distant memories returned to him, and having forgot his first language, began learning German again. His readjustment to his original culture was slow and painful. He rejected the food, sleeping on a bed, and living a sedentary lifestyle. Eventually Herman moved back to Oklahoma, married, and had children. He looked back at his life as one full of adventure, and died in 1932 a full member of the Comanche Nation.</p>
